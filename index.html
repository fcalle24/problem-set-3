    <h1>Caffeine Dominates Americans</h1>
    <img src="\Images\APCSP\coffee.jpg">
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several americans love to have a good cup of joe in the morning. Coffee
      is the fuel of us americans; it is the reason we are able to function in
      the morning.<br/> But why is it that we are so hooked on this smooth brown drink.
      Well believe or not, coffee is similar to a drug. Coffee is very addicting, mainly
    because of the caffeine it contains. </p>

    <h2>Caffeine Withdrawal</h2>

    <p>When a person a stops taking a drug they have been using, they suffer from severe symptoms.
      These symptoms are a part of withdrawal. Like previously said, <br/>coffee also preoduces
      withdrawal symptoms. Luckily, they are more minor than the withdrawal symptoms you get from
      real drugs, i.e. vommiting. The following is a list of coffee withdrawal symptoms.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Headaches</li>
        <li>Fatigue</li>
        <li>Anxiety</li>
        <li>Irritability</li>
        <li>Decreased concentration</li>
        <li>Tremors (only occurs if you are extremely dependent on caffeine)</li>
      </ul>
<h2>Low-Caffeine Coffees</h2>
<p>Sometimes it is too hard for people to completely quit caffeine. An alternative
  to quitting is to lower the amount caffeine in your coffee. Doing this will still
  let you<br/> have some caffeine, but a healthy amoount. Perhaps, you could kill
  your caffeine if you keep lowering the doeses of caffeine. In order to do this process,
  I have provided table with low-caffine coffees.</p>

    <p>This entire time, I have been just listing the negative sides of coffee, but
      coffee does have some benefits and it’s not htat it just gives you energy.</p>

    oral cancer than those who did not.</li>
